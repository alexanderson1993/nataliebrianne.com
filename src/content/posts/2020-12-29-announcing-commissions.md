First off, I highly recommend it. I personally, love traditional mediums (my favorite is watercolor and there's something about the feel of a real pencil on paper), but since I've started drawing digitally my art skills have improved immensely. 



While there are lots of drawing tablets out there, lots of them require Photoshop or other expensive software to go along with them. My preference is the Apple iPad with the Apple Pencil. At the moment, all types of iPads are compatible with the Apple Pencil, so it just depends on what you're looking for. A regular [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/specs/) starts at $329, but you can get it for less if you get it refurbished through Apple. Same great quality, but less expensive. I just looked into it, and it looks like there aren't any iPads currently available for refurbishment, but if you wait a month (or even a week) some should show up.



An[ iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/specs/) is going to give you a bit more storage space, which is useful for storing all of those drawings. It is a bit pricier starting at $599, but again you can get one that's refurbished once they are available.



Don't bother with the iPad Mini. It has a tiny screen and is more expensive than the regular iPad. It has more power behind it, but the small screen is a detriment.)



Finally, you have the [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/). (That's what I've got, although I got mine on a college student discount, smaller size from an earlier generation, and refurbished.) It comes in two sizes, 11" and 12.9". Since that's measured from corner to corner, the 12.9" is significantly bigger. I think mine is an old 9.5", and I like it even if there is a bigger size. It's more portable, in my opinion, and you can zoom in and out on the drawing software. So, going with the 11" wouldn't be an issue. iPad Pro starts at $799, which is a bit of a price tag. It does start with a higher storage capacity though. 



Another thing to consider is that in order to use the iPad for it's intended purpose of drawing, you'll need to get the [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) as well. It responds to the angle and is pressure-sensitive, so you can shade just like a real pencil. It's really cool. There are two generations. 



The First generation is what I have. In order to charge it, you take off the cap on the end and plug it directly into the charging port of the iPad. I've found it takes about 5-10 minutes to charge it fully, and then you have hours of use. It's $99.



The Second generation...well I must say that it's tempting for me to get a new one. It charges by just snapping it magnetically to the side. This is useful for several reasons. One, it is kind of awkward to just have a pencil sticking out of the bottom of your iPad. I've been worried several times that I'll break off the end and have it stuck in the charging port. Having the magnetic thing on the side also makes it harder to lose your pencil, which is a bonus. And, you don't have a pesky cap to lose either. It comes in at $129. 



Here's my recommendation for the best performance at the best price. Go with a regular iPad, but get the bigger storage capability (128 GB). That will bring the cost to $429, which is still less expensive than the iPad Air. I'd also go for the Second Generation Apple Pencil. That brings the cost to $558. 



My personal favorite drawing app is called "Procreate" it's $10 on the App Store, and that's forever. No monthly fees, just a one-time download, and it's yours with every update. It has loads of brushes, you can create your own, and you can download free brushes off the internet (be careful with that though). It really is amazingly fantastic. if he wants to try his hand at animation, it has that capability, and you can export your artwork as a PDF, PNG, JPEG, and more. You could even export it into photoshop. It has layer capabilities and is all-around fantastic. There are lots of tutorials online for using it. Adding that to the package and you're at $568. 



If you go ahead and get the above, you've already spent a lot of money. But if you spend just a bit more, you can get a stellar experience. So here's what I recommend for "extras" to go along with the iPad. 



First, is a [paper screen protector.](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=paperlike+ipad+screen+protector&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) This is going to give the screen grip which makes the Apple pencil feel more like a real pencil and gives you some tooth to work with. Otherwise, the tip will slide all over. Makes for an easier learning curve too. it will also protect the screen from dust and fingerprints, and helps to avoid glare. Win-win all around. There are lots of different ones out there, and the price will vary based on what size/type of iPad you're looking at getting. The one I got was about $10. So, we're at $578. 



Next is a case. Please get him a case. I'm really careful with my iPad and I've still dropped it at least once. The case will protect the precious cargo inside. These vary in price as well. The one I've got cost me $15. Best part, lots of colors, lots of options. Maybe if you were planning on getting him this for Christmas, you can get him an Amazon gift card specifically to pick out a case so he can choose for himself. If we go with the $15 option, we're at $593. So basically $600.



Now, you might think that that's steep, but if you look at other professional drawing tablets that are out there, like Wacom they get a lot steeper for professional-grade things. One of their drawing computers is $3000. Granted, it is just for drawing and I've never used Wacom, so maybe it's an amazing intuitive experience. They do have less expensive options at around the $500 range, but that's not including a case or screen protector. I'm not an expert on Wacom, and I haven't looked much into it, so please do research if you want to go in that direction. What I do know is that my iPad is good enough for me to do professional commission work comfortably from anywhere, and it is reliable.



So, there you have it! Lots of information, but I hope that I helped you in your decision-making process. There's definitely more information on the Apple website, and you can always chat with them before making a purchase. And if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I'm more than happy to talk about how to get into doing commissions or even chat with your son about his talent.
