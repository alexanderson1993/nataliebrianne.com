At first, I thought perchance this love was true

My heart and soul in ecstasy and joy

A plague my gladness could not e’er destroy

This love of mine had changed my point of view

 

He gave me rosy glasses to look through

And whispered promises we might enjoy

All manner of praises did he employ

This lady his to tease and flirt and woo

 

His kiss was gentle, sweet yet in hindsight

Was poisonous and burned intense as fire

I soon found I was not his only dove

 

And yet the signs were clear enough and bright

I should have known the brute to be a liar

How blind was I to think it was true love?
