Here we are at the beginning of another month. We've almost made it to the end of 2020, almost survived. I'm over halfway through my second to last semester in college. And we come to the next challenge, the infamous "Nanowrimo." 

Now, I personally have not participated in Nanowrimo in the past. It isn't that I don't want to write 50,000 words in a month, on the contrary. I would LOVE to get 50,000 words under my belt in that time. Unfortunately, I just haven't had the wherewithal to do it. Somehow, something always gets in the way. Just yesterday I sat in front of my calendar and filled out all the things I needed to focus on this month. All the major projects. To be frank, it was overwhelming. But, despite that, I feel like I owe it to myself to try. After all, if I managed to get 50,000 words out this month in my novel, I'd only have about 20,000 words to get to my target. I could punch that out after finals are over, and spend the first few months of 2021 editing it and sending it back to my publisher. Now that sounds like a good way to start out the new year! 

So, this post is a bit of accountability. It's sort of my way of telling the world that I'm going to at least try. Let's get some goals out. 



1. I don't write on Sundays, which means I'll have to up my word count for the rest of the days. Five Sundays in November means that I only have 25 days to work. 2000 words a day puts me at 50,000. So I have to write at least 2,000 words a day. 

2. If for some reason I can't write on a given day, then I need to make it up during that week at some point. I have to write 12,000 words a week. 

3. In order to accomplish this, I need to avoid my usual distractions, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to hole up and never do anything else. I don't think that's healthy. But, if I am less present on YouTube or scrolling through social media, so be it. That's probably better for me anyway. 



This all sounds fine and dandy, but there are definitely going to be some challenges going into this. I mean, 50,000 words is a lot. I wrote that much in three months this summer, and that was when I didn't have school. November Natalie is definitely up to her ears in school work and freelance work. I have three papers, a final project, two illustration commissions, and an editing commission to work on. That's a lot. I'm not going to have tons of expectations for myself. If I miss a day, I'm not going to beat myself up over it. But if I somehow manage to get to 50,000 words by the end of November, I will definitely be proud.

I currently have two active projects that I'm working on. One is a sequel to my book "Constantine Capers: The Pennington Perplexity." It's in the same series/universe with the same characters. The working title is "Flashes of Memory." It picks up just after my first book while delving into how Detective Constantine lost his memory to begin with. 



My second project is a completely different series and jumps to a different genre. The working title is "The Thirteenth Zodiac," and I suppose the quick pitch is Avatar the Last Airbender meets Star Wars. It's a sci-fi/fantasy hybrid with magic powers in space and an interstellar dragon.
