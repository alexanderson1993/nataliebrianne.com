Spoilers for WandaVision ahead!

At first glance, one may be tempted to place Marvel’s new series *WandaVision1* in the category of “parody.” And you would be right. From the very first episode, it is clear that the writers are taking inspiration from *I Love Lucy* from the conflict of the episode, to Elizabeth Olsen’s facial expressions, to the music and style used for the show’s theme song. With each new episode, we have a new style to experience with slightly different problems for the characters to solve, different filming techniques, and adjusted scripts. The casual viewer picks up on this immediately, even if they aren’t entirely familiar with the earlier shows. Yet, throughout *WandaVision* we see cracks within the superficiality of that sitcom format, which widen, until the whole story is broken down in front of us. Looking back on the entire story, it’s incredibly clear that there is a satirical basis to *WandaVision* as a whole. *WandaVision* utilizes sitcom tropes and techniques in order to explore contemporary escapism.

            *WandaVision* is a unique entertainment experience, that is multifaceted and layered. At the outset, it appears to be just a sitcom following two of our favorite Marvel characters in a domestic setting. If this were all that *WandaVision* was, I’d be all here for it. After all, these two deserve to be happy and live their lives in peace. However, from the very first episode we know that something this amiss, and that feeling of dread and anxiety only increases as the show continues on. While it is masquerading as a traditional sitcom, and paying homage to early TV shows in expert fashion (the writers definitely did their research), it is just a story within a story. We, the audience, are watching a show that contains the fake world of *WandaVision*. Marvel fans are intimately aware of the “real” Marvel universe that is happening around this fake televised domesticity. As the episodes progress, we learn that Wanda herself is in charge of this simulation. So, it is entertainment within entertainment. 

For the internal *WandaVision*, we’re looking at a family situation. In episode one, we are introduced to our main characters, Wanda and Vision, as well as to several members of the supporting cast. Our main characters are newly married and living in suburbia, and closely resemble the character types of Lucy and Ricardo from *I Love Lucy*. While the husband works full time, the wife stays home and focuses on homemaking. Just like in *I Love Lucy,* the couple sleeps in separate beds to begin with. They both reinforce heteronormative gender roles and fulfill their respective positions within their respective spheres. It is also made clear that much of the conflicts within the sitcom will arise from Wanda and Vision’s powers, which is similar to the formats of *Bewitched* and *I Dream of Jeannie*.

            These first episodes are fairly self-contained. Any problems that arise are solved within the time slot and any divergence from the status quo is realigned. There might be a bit of carry over, for instance Wanda is shown as pregnant at the end of episode two and the twins are born in episode three, however the main conflicts are always resolved. This is part of what makes a TV show a sitcom, and what makes them so comforting and familiar. [“We’re sucked into another world, where everything is brightly colored and convenient plot turns solve all the characters’ problems.”](http://smeharbinger.net/why-television-is-used-as-a-coping-mechanism-and-why-we-need-to-stop/) The problems are often familiar to us, like inviting a boss over for dinner and having everything go terribly wrong, but they aren’t our problems. And since we know it will all be set back to normal by the end, there isn’t the stress associated with real life conflict.

            Another attribute that sitcoms usually share is that of run time. The average sitcom is about twenty-two minutes long, with breaks for advertisements that fill up the thirty minute slot. The first episode of *WandaVision* is twenty-nine minutes long, and even though it is streaming on Disney Plus (a streaming service sans advertisements), there are advertisements filtered throughout the first few episodes. These fake ads mimic the advertisements that would have played during sitcoms in the latter half of the twentieth century. But why would fake advertisements be created for a simulation created by Wanda? This is purely for the authenticity. Wanda’s subconscious needs everything to be perfect, and her knowledge of sitcoms tells her that there need to be advertisements. So, they are inserted into the narrative in the exact place where they should be.

            The next item on early sitcom bingo, is laughter. In the early days of television, episodes would be filmed in front of live studio audiences. Episode one of *WandaVision* (the literal one that we, the audience, are watching), pays homage to this with the title “Filmed in Front of a Live Studio Audience.” And this was actually the case. Creator, Jac Schaeffer, wanted to film all of the episodes in front of a live audience, however logistics and filming angles made that impossible. [Despite this, the first episode was actually filmed live in front of friends and family (sworn to secrecy) of the production staff.](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/wandavision-considered-filming-all-episodes-front-live-studio-audience-jac-schaeffer/) This provided authentic laughter, which was not seen for the later episodes. Instead, just like most sitcoms since the 60s, laugh tracks were inserted. Once again, we can assume that Wanda’s unconscious mind was providing the laugh tracks all along. Although, I wouldn’t put it past her grief ridden state to have used the accidentally enslaved residents of Westview to fill her studio audience for episode one.

            As we progress through the episodes, we also see changes in filming styles. The first couple of episodes feel more like they are being filmed on a set, with wider shots. You never see the “fourth wall.” Wanda and Vision are also more physical and engage in more slapstick comedy, which was more common for early sitcoms like *I Love Lucy* and *The Dick Van Dyke Show*. From one episode to the next, the set changes entirely to reflect the new sitcom, as do the opening titles. From the obligatory holiday episode (another sitcom trope) forwards, the actors begin to break the fourth wall. It starts with the twins talking to the camera and moves into a mockumentary format for the remaining “sitcom” episodes within the show. All of these changes signal to the audience what to expect from the episode.

            With all of these tropes and techniques in place, we are left with the question, “why?” Why would in-universe Wanda go through all the trouble to create such an intricate perfect world? This question is answered in episode eight—“Previously On.” This is the first episode that doesn’t contain any traces of the sitcom format, foregoing laugh tracks and commercials for something that is more recognizable as Marvel. Agatha brings Wanda through her memories, and we discover that this version of Westview was created out of necessity, as a coping strategy for Wanda’s grief. 

            This is, in a way, a mirror for the notion of contemporary escapism. Escapism is, at its core, a method for leaving the real world for a little while in the hopes of being free of the stress, fear, and pain of reality. In the Romantic era, this was done by escaping to nature physically, reading, or writing poetry. In our current society, escapism comes in many forms including books, video games, movies, and television. ["95.9 percent of Americans have TVs, according to Nielsen Holdings. And according to the American Psychological Association, 40 percent of Americans use excessive television/video watching to cope with stress."](http://smeharbinger.net/why-television-is-used-as-a-coping-mechanism-and-why-we-need-to-stop/) This is also known as binge-watching, and it is becoming increasingly more common as streaming services and media are flooding our waking world. 

            [For Wanda, she is literally escaping to a fictional world, where she can control each day’s narrative and give herself the happiness that has been stolen from her.](https://www.vulture.com/article/wandavision-marvel-references-easter-eggs-guide.html) At first it isn’t conscious, and in a moment of unsurpassed grief, she creates the world, and with it decides to forget the reason why the world was there to begin with. But over time, she recognizes that she is the one in control, but she justifies it as a need. Eventually, after going through the five stages of grief, she comes to accept that she can’t survive in this fake world and that she must leave it and face her truth. 

            In a similar way, audiences crave sitcoms for their own needs. Sitcoms “give us happy endings, loving relationships, and commiseration between characters, that tells us things aren't really so bad and life does have its compensations. They help reconcile us to the unfairness and incompleteness of life, and with all the limitations imposed from without and within. But when we are incredibly stressed, we binge-watch. One episode turns into two, thirty minutes spreads into hours, and we are left more stressed and injured than we were to begin with. Our coping mechanism has turned against us. [“Television would be like any other healthy form of coping — like going for a walk or writing in a  journal — if we didn’t use it to numb ourselves from our problems.”](http://smeharbinger.net/why-television-is-used-as-a-coping-mechanism-and-why-we-need-to-stop/)

This is contemporary escapism, and like Wanda, it is imperative for us to recognize its effects and face our problems head on. While there is nothing wrong with curling up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn and a remote to watch our favorite comfort show. Comedy is necessary for us to socialize, cope, and process difficult emotions. However, it can become a problem and a detriment to our lives if we are continually numbing ourselves to reality. While *WandaVision* does an excellent job of portraying the tropes of situational comedies, it is equally good at showing us the dangers of allowing ourselves to be sucked into these fictional worlds.
