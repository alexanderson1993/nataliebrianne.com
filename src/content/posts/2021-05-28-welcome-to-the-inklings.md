Why hello there!

I'm so glad that you're interested in keeping up with my author adventures. If you're here, you likely just signed up for my newsletter. What does that entail?

Every two weeks, you'll get an email from me. It may have news about my books, funny memes or jokes that I've found, random historical facts, writing advice, concept art, etc.. Honestly, it may change from week to week. Come to expect the unexpected! Bottom line is, I promise not to fill your inbox with spam and mindless drivel.

As one of my inklings, you'll have early access to advanced reader copies of my books, opportunities for giveaways, exclusive short stories, and be the first to hear about any upcoming projects. 

If all of that sounds like something you'd like to be apart of, pop over to your email. You'll find the first message from me, along with a link to confirm. Clicking that will give you access to my short story "Byron's Oblivion," as well as the first chapter of my novel "Constantine Capers: The Pennington Perplexity," and will ensure that you get my emails in the future.

 Thanks again for supporting me on my writing quest!
