Why hello there!

If you've found your way to this place, allow me to be the first to welcome you to The Inklings.

Once upon a time, J.R.R. Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, and a bunch of others at Oxford would sit around in the Eagle and Child to discuss all things literature. It was like a book club, writing group, and friend group all in one. They were the first Inklings, who I must salute in solidarity.

You, on the other hand, are the most recent member of a secret society of the same name. What does this membership entail?

Every two weeks or so, you'll get an email from me. This may be information about what books I've been reading, funny memes or jokes that I've found, random historical facts, writing advice, concept art, etc.. It will change from week to week. Come to expect the unexpected and you won't be disappointed. Bottom line is, I promise not to fill your inbox with spam and mindless drivel.

As one of my Inklings, you'll have early access to advanced reader copies of my books, opportunities for giveaways, exclusive short stories, and be the first to hear about any upcoming projects. you'll be the first to receive exclusive content such as advanced reader copies of my books, short stories, etc.. In fact, if you're on this page you are one step closer to receiving one such freebie!

If all of that sounds like something you'd like to be apart of, pop over to your email. You'll find the first message from me, along with a link to confirm. This will redirect you to whichever freebie tickled your fancy and brought you down the rabbit hole.

 Thanks again for supporting me on my writing quest!
