When you think about the history of the world, of all the inventions and innovations that have happened in the past 200,000 years or so, our current way of life is a mere fraction of the human condition. 

Movies have been around for a little over a hundred years. Talking pictures, less than a hundred years. Computers, phones, the internet, television, cars, planes. We are on a supercharged track, everything moving faster simply because human innovation seems to be exponential. 

We’ve had the printing press for 580 years. Before that, all writing had to happen by hand. It would take years to create new books but Gutenberg and his press made it possible to make books faster, cheaper, and more effectively. And now? You’re reading text on a screen. Text that I typed faster than any text setter could set text in that printing press. 

I want you to take a second to think about how much has happened in such a short period of time. How incredible it is that we’ve been to the moon? That we’ve placed robots on Mars and have probes leaving our Solar System?

How crazy is it that we can communicate with someone on the other side of the planet in a few seconds? That we know so much about our own bodies? That we’ve sent people to explore the ocean? Humans create so much and things are constantly changing. 

How amazing is it to be human? To breathe in and out, feeling the air in our lungs, and face the new day? 

I know there are a lot of flaws in humanity, and perhaps, there always will be, but there is something beautiful in being human. Just think about it.
