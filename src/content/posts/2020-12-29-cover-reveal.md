When I first started this crazy journey, I didn't really think about what I was doing or where I was going with things. I had just started my degree in Interdisciplinary Humanities at BYU. I was 19 and I just thought that it would be fun to write some of the ideas in my head out on paper. There wasn't really a plan for publication at that point, and I certainly wasn't pursuing a career path as an author. I just loved my characters and wanted to get to know them better.

Less than a year later, I had the first draft on my hands and literally no idea what to do with it. I was 20, had little to no experience with the publishing industry, but knew for a surety that this was what I wanted to do with my life. 

Just before I turned 21, I was introduced to Immortal Works at the Life the Universe and Everything Conference. I didn't know it then, but they would be my publisher and the way I would introduce my characters to the world. 

At 22, they picked up my manuscript, and I spent all of last year revising it, working with editors, finding reviewers, and floundering as I tried to figure out what made an author an author, other than just writing. Somehow, bleeding onto a page is easier than marketing. Who would have thought?

That brings us to today, my 23rd turn around this little blue dot we call home. And with this rotation, I'd like to announce two things:

First, my long-awaited cover reveal, featuring my main characters Byron and Mira.

Secondly, that it is available for preorder on Amazon right now, so if you want to secure a future read, you can do so by following this [link.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WS31F6L?pf_rd_r=44T2MFR2EW3E5YDHK84W&pf_rd_p=5ae2c7f8-e0c6-4f35-9071-dc3240e894a8&pd_rd_r=572cf79d-4f68-4f07-83d6-86b492bc8e08&pd_rd_w=ZAbED&pd_rd_wg=3zt1d&ref_=pd_gw_unk)

This is all pretty surreal for me. In less than a month, I'll be a published author, and soon after that, I'll have a sequel written and sent off to Immortal Works again. Here's to figuring out all of this for the rest of my life.
