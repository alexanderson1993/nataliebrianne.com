In all my blogposts that I've done thus far, I've tried to imbue my own voice into the narrative. That being said, I've never done a proper introduction. Sure, the first page of the website says "Hi there! I'm Natalie Brianne" and there's a lovely author bio, but does that really get to who I am? 

Maybe it doesn't matter who I really am, but I've received some questions and I intend to answer them! So here we go.

#### 1. When did you start writing?

That's a tricky question, as I've technically been writing my entire life. I'm not sure how elementary school went for the rest of the universe, but I have notebooks full of little mini stories that my teachers would have me write. When I was around ten, I fully intended on writing an entire novel on an old rainbow macintosh that my dad gave me. I think I got a few chapters in. However, I really got serious about writing during my sophmore year of college when I started on "Constantine Capers: The Pennington Perplexity."

#### 2. What do you do for work?

I'm trying to make writing my career, but between now and then I'm actually working at the Christa McAuliffe Space Center and Planetarium. It's not the kind of Space Center that you'd find in Texas or Florida. It's got sci-fi spaceship simulators, and my job is to sit in a room with a bunch of computers, a microphone, and a voice changer and tell stories all day. Because of this job, I've got a love of space, acting, and storytelling. Also, working in the second largest planetarium in Utah is pretty fantastic.

Along with that, I also do art commissions! I'm in the process of getting a website put together for my portfolio and then there'll be a full blogpost on that. ;) 

#### 3. Favorite color?

I'm partial to a particular shade of coral pink, with teal blue coming in right behind that. However, sometimes I like other colors better. It depends on the day and the angle of the sun.

#### 4. Favorite author?

Can I skip this one? I have too many! Dorothy L. Sayers is up there, same with Agatha Christie. C.S. Lewis, Neil Gaiman, and Douglas Adams are certainly in the competition. Oh, and I just adore Dickens and Austen. I graduated in the humanities, so I feel like I've read my fair share of the classics.

#### 5. Do you play any instruments?

I played flute for about 4 years when I was younger. I'm trying to get back up to my previous skill with it. I've also been teaching myself guitar, and I'm fairly good. I can play a few songs on the piano, but not very well.

#### 6. Pet Peeve?

It really bothers me when people call me Nat. It's too close to the pronunciation of "gnat" for my liking. There are a finite few individuals who can get away with it, mostly teachers and older adults in my life, but it's generally my least favorite moniker. In junior high I was bothered by my lack of a (good) nickname so I tried to get people to call me Lia. It didn't really stick. 

#### 7. Have you ever broken a bone?

No, but I have had stitches. On Christmas Eve. After running into a couch. Great fun, that!

#### 8. Has a book ever made you cry?

Definitely. The first time I remember this happening was with "Fahrenheit 451," although I'm sure I cried before then. Granted, those tears were out of shock rather than sadness!

#### 9. Why did you choose Victorian London for your book?

It felt right for the story I wanted to tell. Honestly, the whole idea for the book came from a roleplay game I did with some friends. Byron was a friend's character and Mira was mine. He came up with the idea of the amnesiac "Sherlockian" detective, and our game was set in Victorian London. So, when I started writing the story, it was most natural to keep it in that time period. I also am rather partial to the Victorian period, although I know that there were a lot of issues as well. No time period is immune to them. And of course, when I went on my study abroad I lived in London for six weeks and fell in love all over again!

#### 10. What are you working on?

Well, I'm currently working on the "Constantine Capers" sequel. It does have a name, but I'll be keeping that to myself for the moment. ;) 

I've also been working on a sci-fi fantasy hybrid. While I didn't intend it this way to begin with, it's kind of turned into a "Avatar: The Last Airbender" meets "Star Wars" story. It's been a lot of fun (although an entirely different challenge) to be able to make up my own lore and magic, rather than researching history like crazy.

And there you have it! A bit of an introduction into the real me, some information on my book, and a generally chill blogpost. I hope you enjoyed it!
