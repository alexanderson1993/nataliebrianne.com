      managed to solve over 40 cases despite that. He’s 27 years old, has an
      impeccable sense of style, and plays the piano. How did he end up with

    description: This is Mira Blayse, an artist and accidental non-conformist. It’s
      not her fault that her hair doesn’t stay styled. While she’s shy and prone
      to blush, she isn’t afraid to go out of her comfort zone to find the
      truth. She’s 22 years old, has a twin, is ambidextrous, and has an
      unhealthy love of French toast.
