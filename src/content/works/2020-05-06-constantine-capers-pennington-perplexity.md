    description: This is actually my very first piece of concept art that I ever
      drew for this book. I remember drawing this in my dorm in Italy at the
      tail end of my study abroad. It’s a visualization of my two characters and
      the underlying conflict. Byron’s tophat, Mira’s fan, and a watch to show
      Byron’s memory loss. I still love how it all looks together.
  - title: Cover Mock-Up
    description: This is a potential cover idea that I created for the book. I was
      inspired by the Art Nouveau style in one of my classes and decided I
      wanted to try it out. It ended up more like a stained glass window though.
      The front shows more of the mystery and the historical setting, while the
      back alludes to the romance. I’m still not sold on the colors, but for a
      first try at a book cover, I’m pretty pleased. Granted, this isn’t the
      actual cover of my book.

      actually comes from a picture I took of Jane Austen's wallpaper in

  - name: Byron Constantine
    description: This is Byron Constantine, a private detective with short term
      memory loss. Every day he wakes up and can’t remember the day before. He’s
      managed to solve over 40 cases despite that. He’s 27 years old, has an
      impeccable sense of style, and plays the piano. How did he end up with
      short term memory loss? Well, even he doesn’t know.

  - name: Mira Blayse
    description: This is Mira Blayse, an artist and accidental non-conformist. It’s
      not her fault that her hair doesn’t stay styled. While she’s shy and prone
      to blush, she isn’t afraid to go out of her comfort zone to find the
      truth. She’s 22 years old, has a twin, is ambidextrous, and has an
      unhealthy love of French toast. She’s also never flown on a dirigible, but
      maybe that will change.

You wouldn’t expect a detective with Sherlockian deductive skills to have amnesia, but Byron Constantine is hardly the detective you’d expect.



London 1888



Aspiring artist Mira Blayse isn’t concerned with upper-tier society or conforming to Victorian expectations—she has a murder to solve. At least, she thinks it was murder. Her parents’ deaths in 1870 couldn’t have been by accident, but the more she investigates, the less she seems to find. Sitting at a café, she sketches a mysterious stranger, not realizing that she’s penciling in the features of the man who will help her solve the case once and for all.



Byron Constantine lives day-to-day, desperately trying to hold onto his memories, only for them to slip through his fingers. Some days, he doesn’t even know that he’s lost four years of his life. As he manages to continue his work as a private detective, he realizes that maybe he doesn’t need his memory after all. That is until he wants to remember Mira Blayse.



With her keen eye for detail and his remarkable deductive skills, the two become entangled in a criminal investigation. As they uncover the secrets of the past, they must work together to stop history from repeating itself again.
