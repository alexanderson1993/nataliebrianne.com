The sound of fall leaves crackling against the sidewalk is pushed through the window by the same wind that blows them around in dust-devils. It's a pleasant sound. Summer has come to a close, and the amount of blankets on my bed now is a good indicator of that.&nbsp;<div>
</div><div>Autumn means we are in the decline towards winter, and more specifically that limbo that is January. December doesn't really count as Winter to me. Yes, it is cold and that is when the solstice is. But with school getting out for a few weeks and the holiday spirit so tangible, it doesn't quite count. January is the dull-gray mood that creeps in at the beginning of every year. It's inevitable.</div><div>
</div><div>Just like the feeling of being an imposter. There are plenty of people who have talked about it before, and I'm sure more people will talk about it later, but this is something that I deal with at least once a week, if not more.&nbsp;</div><div>
