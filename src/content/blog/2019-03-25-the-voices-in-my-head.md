Who would have thought it would take this long to get back into this? I certainly didn't. A lot has happened over the last few months, including me sending my book off to the publishers! Haven't heard back from them yet, but I should any day now.

The other day I was driving home from work and I had this strange feeling of really missing my characters. Or more specifically, my characters missing me. It's strange to say that I have voices in my head. The voices are more like remembering the voice of your mother or an old friend talking to you years ago. They can be fully fledged sentences or just emotions, but the voice is there. Someone is wanting to speak. It's been a few months since I last wrote in a literary sense. Between all the essays, term papers, and reports along with the rest of my hectic life, I just haven't had the time. And they've been patiently waiting inside me. Waiting for an opportunity to emerge and find their place again. But their patience, much like mine, is thinner than most. A few months is too long for them to remain dormant. So as I was driving I wasn't surprised that some dialog popped into my head. Some longing, yearning, burning desire to write for them again.

I haven't actually listened to that desire. Life continues to be too hectic. But I keep thinking about it. Sometime this week I'll have a spare moment to read through what I already have. From there, I can start framing the next chapter and then the next. By the end of April all my commitments will melt away and then I can find my shining silver mountaintop and meditate my way into another realm. That isn't to say I'll go hiking to find my muse, but maybe I will. We'll have to see.
